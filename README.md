# qualstat

qualstat is a C library for quickly gathering quality statistics from
sequence files. It's mostly adapted from
[qrqc](http://github.com/vsbuffalo/qrqc), but the two will be merged
at some point. It's part of a sequencing quality pipeline I am
building. It's in alpha and is fairly simplistic at this point.
